##  Overview

FakeSniffer is an open-source software application developed primarily for detecting potential threats in software applications, facilitating secure software development practices. Leveraging a unified Spring Boot platform, it offers integrated Web, REST APIs, Websocket, and JPA (Java Persistence API) functionality. Key functionalities include client data management through Spring Data JPA repositories, report retrieval based on client ID and date ranges, real-time WebSocket connectivity for messaging between clients and the server, and machine learning model integration for content generation and filtering decisions. With robust test coverage using the SpringBoot testing environment, FakeSniffer promises enhanced security and reliability in software development projects.

##  Features

|   |    Feature          | Description                                                                |
|---|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**    | A Java project based on Spring Boot v3.3.1, with multi-module development setup, integrating Web, REST APIs, Websockets, JPA (Java Persistence API), and leveraging PostgreSQL as the database. Uses Lombok for simplified coding style. |
|üî© | **Code Quality**    | Clean and well-structured code using Spring conventions. Leverages proper indentation, comments, and modularization best practices. |
|üìÑ | **Documentation**   | Good quality documentation provided for major components through Javadoc comments. Some sections could benefit from expanded explanations for easier onboarding and understanding by new contributors. |
|üîå | **Integrations**    | Uses various libraries like Spring Data JPA, RestTemplate, WebSocket, LTTM (Long Term Transcript Model), LamModel (LAM model), QuestionGeneration service, and external APIs for transcription. |
|üß© | **Modularity**      | The project is broken down into different services, controllers, configurations, models, and utility classes, promoting reusability and modifying individual components with minimal impact on others. |
|üï∞Ô∏è | **Performance**    | Real-time messaging via WebSocket provides efficient communication between clients and the server. Periodic analysis of client conversations through LAM model and LTTM is performed every second. |
|üåçÔ∏è  | **Scalability**    | With an event-driven architecture (WebSocket) and modularized design, FakeSniffer could scale horizontally by adding more servers for handling a larger number of clients and conversations. |
